**[LLFn](https://github.com/orgexyz/LLFn) has only one goal**: making it 100x easier to experiment and ship AI applications using the LLMs with minimum boilerplate. Even if you're new to LLMs, you can still get started and be productive in minutes, instead of spending hours learning how to use the framework.

- **ðŸ”‹ Functionify**: turning any `prompt` into a callable function.
- **ðŸ“¤ Flexible Output**: defining LLM result with Python and [`pydantic`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) types.
- **ðŸ§± Infinitely Composable**: any function can call any other function in any order.
- **ðŸ›’ Use Any LLM**: leveraging [`LangChain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)'s LLM interface, drop in your favorite LLM with 100% compatibility.
- **ðŸª¶ Light-Weight**: small core framework of LLFn making it extremely easy to understand and extend.

We draw a lot of inspiration from both [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), so if you're familiar with either of them you'd feel right at home with LLFn.
